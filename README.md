## 📖 Overview

Misconfigurations remain one of the leading causes of cloud data breaches. **CloudSentinel AI** helps catch these issues before they become incidents by automatically scanning your AWS environment and presenting the results in a clear, actionable dashboard.

The application inspects key AWS services, assigns severity levels and risk scores to each finding, and uses AI to suggest practical remediation steps — so you know not just *what's* wrong, but *how* to fix it.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Automated scanning of AWS resources for common misconfigurations
- 🔑 Detects IAM users without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- 🔒 Detects missing or weak IAM password policies
- 🌐 Detects Security Groups exposing SSH (port 22) to the internet
- 🪣 Detects S3 buckets with versioning disabled
- 🤖 AI-generated remediation suggestions for every finding
- 📄 Professional PDF security report generation
- 📊 Interactive dashboard with charts and severity statistics
- 🔎 Search, filter, and sort findings in real time
- 🔐 API key authentication to secure backend access

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user starts a security scan from the dashboard.
2. The React frontend sends a request to the FastAPI backend.
3. The backend authenticates the request using an API key.
4. The scanner connects securely to AWS via the Boto3 SDK.
5. A set of security scanners analyzes AWS resources in parallel.
6. Findings are aggregated into a single security report.
7. AI generates remediation recommendations for each finding.
8. Results are rendered in the dashboard and can be exported as a PDF report.

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/cloudsentinel-ai.git
cd cloudsentinel-ai
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will typically run at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder with the following keys:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
CLOUDSENTINEL_API_KEY=
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your AWS credentials or API keys to GitHub.** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` before pushing any changes.
